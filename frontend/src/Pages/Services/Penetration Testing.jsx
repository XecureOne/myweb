                    Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) is a
                    combined security approach used to identify and fix
                    weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications.
                    Vulnerability Assessment scans and lists potential security
                    flaws without exploiting them. Penetration Testing goes
                    further by simulating real-world attacks to exploit those
                    vulnerabilities. Together, they help measure both the risk
                    and impact of security gaps. VAPT can be performed
                    periodically or after major system changes. Its goal is to
                    strengthen security by finding and fixing weaknesses before
                    attackers can exploit them.
